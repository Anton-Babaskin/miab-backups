miab-backups

Automated Restic backups to a WebDAV remote via rclone, with Telegram notifications.

📦 Prerequisites





Bash (#!/usr/bin/env bash)



restic installed and in $PATH



rclone configured with a WebDAV remote (e.g., webdavbox)



jq installed for parsing Telegram API responses



flock for preventing concurrent cron runs (usually pre-installed)

⚙️ Configuration





Copy and secure the environment file:

sudo cp .env.example /etc/miab-notify.env
sudo chmod 600 /etc/miab-notify.env



Edit /etc/miab-notify.env with your Telegram bot credentials and Restic password:

BOT_TOKEN="123456789:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"
CHAT_ID="987654321"
RESTIC_PASSWORD="your_secure_password_here"



Make scripts executable:

chmod +x scripts/*.sh
sudo chmod 700 scripts/*.sh  # Restrict access



Ensure log file is writable:

sudo touch /var/log/restic.log
sudo chmod 600 /var/log/restic.log



Configure rclone:

Ensure a WebDAV remote (e.g., webdavbox) is set up in rclone. Test it:

rclone lsd webdavbox:/backup

🔔 Telegram Notification Helper

scripts/telegram_notify.sh sends notifications to a Telegram chat. It:





Sources credentials from /etc/miab-notify.env.



Escapes special characters for Telegram API compatibility.



Retries on network failures (3 attempts, 10-second timeout).



Verifies API responses using jq.

💾 Backup Script

scripts/restic-rclone-backup.sh performs the following:





Validates dependencies (restic, rclone, jq), backup source (/home/user-data), log file, and WebDAV remote.



Initializes the Restic repository if it doesn't exist.



Backs up /home/user-data to rclone:webdavbox:/backup.



Verifies repository integrity with restic check.



Prunes old backups (--keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 6).



Logs all actions to /var/log/restic.log.



Sends Telegram notifications on success or failure, including backup duration.

Security Notes





RESTIC_PASSWORD is sourced from /etc/miab-notify.env, not hard-coded.



Scripts should be restricted (chmod 700) to prevent unauthorized access.



Telegram credentials are stored securely in /etc/miab-notify.env.

🔧 Usage Examples

Manual Test

Run with debugging output:

bash -x scripts/restic-rclone-backup.sh

Cron Entry for Nightly Backup

Add to crontab (crontab -e) to run at 4 AM, using flock to prevent concurrent runs:

0 4 * * * flock -n /tmp/restic-backup.lock /path/to/miab-backups/scripts/restic-rclone-backup.sh >> /var/log/restic.log 2>&1

Replace /path/to/miab-backups with the actual path to the repository.

Verify Backups

Periodically test restorability (e.g., monthly):

restic -r rclone:webdavbox:/backup restore latest --target /tmp/restore-test

📁 Notes





All sensitive data (Telegram credentials, Restic password) is stored in /etc/miab-notify.env, excluded by .gitignore.



Scripts include validation checks to ensure reliability.



trap ERR sends Telegram alerts on any failure.



flock prevents concurrent cron runs, protecting the Restic repository.



Logs are centralized in /var/log/restic.log for easy debugging.



Consider monitoring cron execution (e.g., via a "heartbeat" notification) to detect scheduling issues.

🛠️ Troubleshooting





Backup fails: Check /var/log/restic.log for errors.



No Telegram notifications: Verify BOT_TOKEN and CHAT_ID in /etc/miab-notify.env, and ensure jq is installed.



WebDAV issues: Test the remote with rclone lsd webdavbox:/backup.



Cron not running: Confirm the cron daemon is active (systemctl status cron) and the lock file isn't stuck (rm /tmp/restic-backup.lock).
